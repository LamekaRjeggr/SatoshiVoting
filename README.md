  # Satoshi Voting

## Repository Overview
This repository is part of the [Bitcoin Voting Protocol](link-to-main-project) project and focuses on exploring a method of voting by detecting transactions to specific addresses on the Bitcoin network. The idea is to use Bitcoin transactions as votes, where each transaction to a designated address represents a vote.

## Method Description
- **Approach**: Utilizing the Bitcoin mempool to scan for incoming transactions to two specific addresses. Each transaction represents a vote.
- **Libraries Used**: `bitcoinlib` for interacting with the Bitcoin network.

## Current Progress
- Selected Python as the programming language for ease of use and extensive libraries.
- Chose `bitcoinlib` as the Bitcoin library for interacting with the Bitcoin network.
- [Further progress updates...]

## Challenges and Stopping Points
- [Document any challenges faced or points where further exploration is needed...]
