There is no method to allow our voice to be heard in a verifiable and easily accessible way. 

### Purpose
The search for a verifiable, trustless, transparent, incurruptable and free method for voting from any device.  



## SatoshiVote System Outline

### Protocol
To create a universally accessible open voting process ~~on Bitcoin or Lightning networks~~ **consider** a method where anyone can vote at anytime, about anything. ~~are represented by transactions sent to specific addresses representing different voting **choices**. Any wallet could send microtransactions to these addresses to vote. The vote tally could be verified by checking the balance or transaction count of these addresses inside of the mempool. Implementing a smart contract or a protocol layer like DLCs could further automate vote tallying and verification. This setup promotes wallet-agnostic voting while leveraging the transparency and immutability of blockchain for vote verification.~~
