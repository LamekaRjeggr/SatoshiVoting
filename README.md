### Problem
There is no method to allow our voice to be heard in a verifiable and easily accessible way. 

### Purpose
A Bitcoin native process that allows anyone to setup a vote about anything  ~~have community controlled verifiying process built by concencus from day one.~~ This is the goal. Bitcoin Timechain referenced or mempool referenced/ low or no fee. 



## SatoshiVote System Outline

### Protocol
To create a universally accessible voting system on Bitcoin or Lightning networks, **consider** a method where votes are represented by transactions sent to specific addresses representing different voting **choices**. Any wallet could send microtransactions to these addresses to vote. The vote tally could be verified by checking the balance or transaction count of these addresses inside of the mempool. Implementing a smart contract or a protocol layer like DLCs could further automate vote tallying and verification. This setup promotes wallet-agnostic voting while leveraging the transparency and immutability of blockchain for vote verification.
