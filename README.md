# SatoshiVotingMVP
SatoshiVote: universally accessible voting protocol based on the GOAT (Merging Nostr protocol with the Bitcoin and Lightning networks to create a decentralized, transparent voting methodology and application.)
## SatoshiVote System Outline

### Protocol
To create a universally accessible voting system on Bitcoin or Lightning networks, **consider** a method where votes are represented by transactions sent to specific addresses representing different voting **choices**. Any wallet could send microtransactions to these addresses to vote. The vote tally can be verified by checking the balance or transaction count of these addresses. Implementing a smart contract or a protocol layer like DLCs could further automate vote tallying and verification. This setup promotes wallet-agnostic voting while leveraging the transparency and immutability of blockchain for vote verification.  

### Setup
First, we would need to set up a system to facilitate the voting process. This could be a website or application where users can participate in the vote. Integrating **Decentralization** principles in the setup phase could enhance the #CensorshipResistance of the platform.

### User Registration
Users would need to register is some way to insure votes are real people and in the locality they say if chosen, providing a #Bitcoin address where they want their satoshis returned after the vote. Utilizing **Public Key Cryptography** could further secure the user registration process.

### Voting Options
Define the voting options as well as the associated Bitcoin addresses. Each voting option should have a unique Bitcoin address where users can send their satoshis to cast their vote. The design of voting options could benefit from the **Simplicity And Flexibility** inherent in Nostr, as discussed previously.

### Vote Casting
Users would select their preferred voting option on your platform and click a "Vote" button. Behind the scenes, your system would generate a Bitcoin transaction sending one satoshi from the user's registered address to the designated voting address associated with their choice. This process could be streamlined through the **Integration With Bitcoin And Lightning Network**.

### Confirmation
To ensure that the vote is counted, users should receive a transaction ID or a confirmation once their vote is successfully cast. This step is critical for the overall **Security** of the voting process.

### Vote Tallying
As votes are cast, you would monitor the Bitcoin blockchain or #LightningNetwork for incoming transactions to the voting addresses. You would then tally the votes based on the addresses that received the satoshis. This step could benefit from a **Comparability To Bitcoin** approach, ensuring accurate and transparent vote tallying.

### Anonymity
Ensure that the voting process preserves the anonymity of users, so that individual voting choices cannot be easily traced back to specific users. Techniques like CoinJoin can help enhance privacy, tying back to the earlier discussion on **Privacy**.

### Results
Display the voting results in real-time or after the voting period has ended. Providing a clear and accessible display of results aligns with the **Accessibility** goal, ensuring that a broad audience can easily understand the voting outcomes.

### Additional Considerations
- **Transaction Fees**
- **Scalability**
- **Legal and Ethical Considerations**
- **User Education**
- **Testing** 

To ensure the integrity, user-friendliness, and legal compliance of the voting platform.
